### This notebook demonstrates basic machine learning concepts using the Iris dataset.

## Sections:
1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Calculates and verifies the Pearson correlation coefficient between two sample data sets.
2. Linear Regression:
* Loads the Iris dataset.
* Splits the data into training and testing sets.
* Trains a Linear Regression model.
* Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
* Visualizes the actual vs predicted values.
    
3.Random Forest Classifier with PCA:
* Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the Iris dataset.
* Splits the PCA-transformed data into training and testing sets.
* Trains a Random Forest Classifier.
* Evaluates the model using accuracy score.
* Displays a confusion matrix.
